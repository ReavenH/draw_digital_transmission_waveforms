# draw_digital_transmission_waveforms

## Preface
- This is a MATLAB script that helps to draw voltage or logic waveforms in digital transmissions. I created this rudimentary version when doing a Communication Theory homework.
- Because of coursework, I will not be able to revise the comments in the script which are currently in Chinese.
- **AD for myself: if you are teaching at a U.S. university, please check my [resume](https://github.com/ReavenH/ReavenH/blob/main/CV_ZhongmingHUANG(public).pdf) if you are interested. I am looking for a 2023-fall PhD position, thank you!**    

## How to use it
- type in the logic voltage level (0 or 1) in the variable `digital_signal` in the beginning rows.
- click `RUN` , and the diagrams after various modulation methods will appear in different figure windows.

## What kinds of modulation are included
- Unipolar non-return to zero code waveform.
- Bipolar non-return to zero code waveform.
- Unipolar return to zero code waveform.
- Bipolar return to zero code waveform.
- Differential relative code and differential code waveforms.
- Manchester code waveform.
- AMI code waveform.
- HDB3 code waveform.
- 2PSK and 2DPSK waveforms and their filter demodulation waveforms.
- 4PSK waveform.
- 2FSK waveform.
