# draw_digital_transmission_waveforms
- This is a MATLAB script that helps to draw voltage or logic waveforms in digital transmissions. I created this rudimentary version when doing a Communication Theory homework.
- Because of coursework, I will not be able to revise the comments in the script which are currently in Chinese.
